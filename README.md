R5, X4, and R5X4 are three types of HIV-1 viruses that differ in their ability to use different co-receptors to enter cells. CCR5 is the co-receptor most commonly used by R5 viruses, while CXCR4 is the co-receptor most commonly used by X4 viruses. R5X4 viruses can use both CCR5 and CXCR4.

The ability of an HIV-1 virus to use different co-receptors can have a significant impact on its pathogenesis. R5 viruses are typically associated with a slower progression of disease than X4 viruses. This is because CCR5 is more abundant in macrophages and dendritic cells, which are the primary targets of HIV-1 infection early in the course of the disease. As the disease progresses, the virus may switch to using CXCR4, which is more abundant in T cells. This switch may be associated with a more rapid progression of disease.
